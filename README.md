# Lab of Legends Auto Roller
 Auto Passive Scummer

created by Cyclonus101

Launched June 2.0

Function: Auto select a passive for a champ in Labs of Legends (a Legends of Runeterra game mode)

Required : Only works on windows 7 or newer and requires AutoHotKey to be installed

Instructions :

1) Download as zip file
2) Unzip project into a folder
3) Double click the AutoPassiveScummer2.ahk file to start script
4) Select Resolution (1920x1080 or 2560x1440 is currently supported)
6) Select Passive
7) Select additional delay if the script runs too fast between scenes
9) Pick a champ to play in the labs mode
10) Press CTRL+M to start the script, press CTRL+P to pause, press CTRL+X to exit the script

Warnings: If you change monitor resolution while the script and Legends of  Runeterra is running 
then you should restart the script and Legends of Runeterra. Otherwise it probably won't work.

Some bugs I've discovered so far:

1) If you switch to 2560x1440 you need to select Advanced Preparations in the passive menu again
2) Because Riot decided to reuse the sorcery icon for slow but steady, selecting either as your starter passive will select the first one it sees
3) Sometimes the icon will be skipped over its in a certain positive (I.E middle) 
4) Sometimes the wrong passive might be selected

Hopefully I'll fix them in the future.
